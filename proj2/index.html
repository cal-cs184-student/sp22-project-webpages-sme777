    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>This project was super fun because I had a lot of experience with Bezier curves and surfaces but never really understood the inner workings of
      it. Unfortunately, I started very very late, so I did not get to finish the last subproblem which I am sure would have been very insightful as well.
      In this project, we start by working with Bezier curves and surfaces and implementing the famous de Casteljau algorithm. We then move on to working with
      <i>Haldedge</i> data structure to represent objects using polygons. In addition, we implement edge splits and flips for these polygons, which are crucial for
      upsampling polygon meshes.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm constructs high dimensional curves by iteratively introducing auxiliary points computed using the <i>lerp</i> function.
      Each of these new points is computed for a pair of points so that by the end of a layer, there will be <strong>n-1</strong> points (given initially we had n points).
      This process is continued until there is only one point remaining, at which point, the algorithm stops. Now, the whole algorithm was built around this point,
      because by toggling the value of <i>t</i> (which we will cover shortly), we get an evolution of the singular point, as a curve. The point <i>t</i> is
      really a metric for computing how much of each point's coordinates should be given to the new auxiliary point. The value of <i>t</i> ranges from 0 to 1. In the pictures
      below we show a list of 6 points that make up a Bezier curve.

  <p>
    An important thing to note is that when we scroll with the mouse, the blue points (and lines) change, but it seems like the red
    dot always remains on the curve. This is exactly what the algorithm was trying to do. By scrolling the value of <i>t</i> in the range,
    it is able to capture the evolution of the red point, and thus the final curve.
  </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces almost too naturally. In fact, we can generalize the de Casteljau algorithm to any dimension.
      For 3D, we have two vectors and two points that we would like to evaluate. Recall that for 1D this was one vector and one point we wanted to evaluate.
      These points are denoted as <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>. We start by running the <i>evaluate1D</i> algorithm for all rows of the provided matrix using
      the value of <i>u</i>, and then running <i>evaluate1D</i> one more time with the output of the loop before but this time with <i>v</i>. A picture of the Bezier
      surface teapot is shown below.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

    <p>
      The hardest part about working in this section was understanding the <i>Halfedge</i> data structure. Initially, I thought I could just get to coding
      and figure as I go. That ended up being a horrible idea and cost me a decent amount of time. So, I started from scratch and really tried to understand
      what the data structure was trying to achieve. Once I got that out of the way, implementing this method was very straightforward. We traverse the mesh using
      halfedges and keep a running sum of the normal of each face. Instead of naively going over all the triangles, we are careful in updating <i>Halfedge</i> such that
      only faces which include the current vertex show up. In the end, we normalize the running sum and return that value. This is the area-weighted normal at a
      given vertex. The picture of the teapot below illustrates the difference before and after applying the area-averaged normals.

    </p>

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="aan1.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Without area-averaged normals.</figcaption>
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="aa2.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">With area-averaged normals.</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

    <p>
      This and the next part are simply bookkeeping, which does not mean that's an easy thing to do. However, by this point, I was already very familiar with
      the <i>Halfedge</i> data structure, so implementing this part was not too terrible. The thing that helped me the most was drawing the before and after
      results of an edge flip. I tagged the <i>Halfedges</i> that would change, as well as other primitives (i.e. vertices, edges, faces). I labeled all <i>Halfedges</i>
      for clarity and then moved on to swapping pointers until the desired outcome was reached. The few pictures below illustrate me having fun with edge flips.
    </p>

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="part4-1.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">One edge flip.</figcaption>
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="part4-2.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Three edge flips</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <br>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="part4-3.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Multiple edge flips.</figcaption>
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="part4-4.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Edge flips MATRIX.</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      I was surprised not to have to debug at all for this part. I think I learned from my mistakes on the previous task and ended up doing
      a lot of planning beforehand. What I found interesting was the existence of a degenerate case (i.e. last picture). I tried to find a way to
      algorithmically identify when a degenerate case would occur but did not have much success.

    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

    Much like the other part, this problem came down to a lot of bookkeeping. Splitting edges was a bit more difficult though because we needed to create
    a few more data structures, but once that was done, the rest was again moving pointers around. The picture below shows splitting edges with and without
    flipping edges.

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="part5-1.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">A few edge splits.</figcaption>
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="part5-2.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">More nested edge splits.</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <br>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="part5-3.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Edge splits with flips.</figcaption>
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="part5-4.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Edge splits with flips from top.</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>

      </table>
    </div>
    <p>

      Unlike the last part, I did have to do some debugging because the mesh was not being correctly displayed. After reviewing my notes and
      implementation I realized that I was assigning a <i>Halfedge</i> to the wrong face. Updating that assignment ended up solving the issue.
